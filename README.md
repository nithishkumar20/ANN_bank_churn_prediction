# ANN_Bank_Churn_Prediction

# Aim: 
Predict customer churn of a bank using  Artificial Neural Networks with the help of Tensorflow2.0 and Keras.

# Methodology: 
Performed a key role in building a Deep Learning model which was evaluated using accuracy metrics. 
The project aims to develop Artificial Neural Network for prediction of the dependent variable. 
The techniques involved are feature engineering, cleaning data, handling missing values and builiding the ANN model.
